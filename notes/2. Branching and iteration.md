## Strings

the sequences of characters, the characters can be letters, special characters, spaces and even digits (but in a sequence). string values are always enclosed in quotation marks or single quotes
`hi = "hello there"`
we can also concatenate stings(link two strings together)
```
name = "seth"
greet = hi + " " + name
print(greet)
>> hello there seth
```

we can also perform operations on a string, there is a list of mostly used operations on [[Strings]] in the elaborations. for ex:
```
greet = (hi + " " + name + " ") * 3
print(greet)
>> hello there seth hello there seth hello there seth
```

## Input/Output: print

used to output data/stuff to the console, in order to do so we use `print` command
```
x = 12
print(x)
y = str(x)
print(y)
print(len(y))
>>12
>>12
>>2
```

now what i did here is i converted the `int` value of `x` that is 12 to `str` and stored it in `y` so now when i do `print(len(y))` i get 2 because there are two elements in the string y that 1 and 2 whose indexes are 0 and 1.

```
print("my fav num is", x, ".", "x =", x)
print("my fav num is " + y + " . " + "x = " + y)
>>>my fav num is 12 . x = 12
>>>my fav num is 12 . x = 12
```

the both print commands give the same output to the console but the difference lies in how they are written in the first one we use `,` and no string value(y), the second one is only using strings and `+` operator. The reason they give same output is because in first print command the `,` gives automatic spacing in the output in second we are using `+` to concatenate, concatenation is only feasible with strings.

## Getting input from user

```
text = input("type anything... ")
print(5 * text)
```

prints whatever is in the quotes, user types in something and hits enter which binds the value to the variable `text` in this case and then prints the output as defined in the print command.
input gives you a string so must cast if working with numbers

```
num = int(input("type a number... "))
print(5 * num)
```

by default python will take every input as a `string` until and unless we cast it as `int` or any datatype in the code itself.

## Comparison operators on int, float and string

`i` and `j` are the variable names, and the comparison done below evaluate to a boolean(true or false)
```
i > j
i >= j
i < j
i <= j
i == j   #equality test
i != j   #inequality test (! stands for not)
```

## Logic operators on bools

`a` and `b` are variable names (with boolean values)
not `a`   - True if `a` is False, False if `a` is True
`a` and `b` - True if both are True
`a` or `b` - True if either or both are True

| A     | B     | A and B | A or B |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| True  | True  | True    | True   |
| True  | False | False   | True   |
| False | True  | False   | True   |
| False | False | False   | True   |
when we use `and` or `or` in python, we dont have to give just `True` or `False`. we can use numbers, strings, lists, or any variable. Python treats values based on "truthiness" (true or false in boolean context):
- False values are `0`, `""` (empty string), `[]` (empty list), `{}` (empty dictionary), `None`, `False`
- True values are anything else than false (ik)
### `and` Operator
- returns the first false value it finds
- if all values are true, it returns the last value
### `or` Operator
- returns the first true value it finds.
- if all values are false, it returns last value.

| Expression        | Result    | Why                             |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `0` and `"hello"` | `0`       | `0` is false , stops there      |
| `"hi"` and `123`  | `123`     | both are true, returns last     |
| `""` or `"hello"` | `"hello"` | only true statement is returned |
| `0` or `""`       | `""`      | both are false, returns last    |

## Control Flow - Branching

if we want to execute a certain expression on a certain data that might or might not be given by user we use `if` command
```
if <condition>:
    <expression>
    <expression>
    ...
```

if somehow the above condition is not satisfied and we want to execute another expression in that case, we use `if - else` command
```
if <condition>:
	<expression>
	<expression>
	...
else:
	<expression>
	<expression>
	...
```

if we have another if condition before finally arriving at else we use `elif` command
```
if <condition>:
	<expression>
	<expression>
	...
elif <condition>:
	<expression>
	<expression>
	...
else:
	<expression>
	<expression>
	...
```

`<condition>` has a value that might be `True` or `False`
if `<condition>` is `True` the evaluation of expression in that block occurs

```
a = float(input("Enter a number for a: "))
b = float(input("Enter a number for b: "))
if a == b:
	print("the values for a and b are equal")
	if a != b:
		print("Therfore, a / b is", a/b)
elif a < b:
	print("a is smaller")
else:
	print("b is smaller")
print("danke!")
```

## Control Flow - Loops

loops in any programming language is used to keep executing a expression until the condition is false.

### while loops

```
while <condition>:
	<expression>
	<expression>
	...
```

- `<condition>` evaluates to a boolean
- if `<condition>` is `True`, all the expression inside the while code block are executed
- check `<condition>` again
- repeat until `<condition>` is `False`

```
n = 0
while n <= 5:
	print(n)
	n = n + 1
>>>1
>>>2
>>>3
>>>4
>>>5
```

### for loops

```
for <variable> in range (<some_num>)
	<expression>
	<expression>
	...
```

- each time through the loop, `<variable>` takes a value.
- first time, `<variable>` starts at the smallest value.
- next time, `<variable>` gets the prev. value +1 etc.
- it goes until the `<variable>` reaches `(<some_num>)-1`.

#### range (start, stop, step)

- default values are `start = 0` and `step = 1` and optional
- loop until the value is `stop - 1`
```
mysum = 0
for i in range(7, 10):
	mysum += i
print(mysum)
>>>24
```

in this one `i` starts with 7 and goes till 10-1 = 9 and so `mysum = 24`

```
mysum = 0
for i in range(5, 11, 2):
	mysum += i
print(mysum)
>>>21
```

in this one `i` starts with 5 and increment 2 times every time it repeats till the value of `i` reaches 11 - 1 = 10 but i cant reach 10 so it stops at 9.

the reason the loop or even string ends at `n-1` is because of the indexing in python and other programming languages, begins with 0 so if there are 11 elements in range or string it will only go to or show up-to 10, from 0 to 10 there are 11 elements. Also the range should always be `int` values.

### Break Statement

- immediately exits whatever loop it is in.
- skips remaining expressions in code block
- exits only innermost loop

```
while <condition_1>:
	while <condition_2>:
		<expression_a>
		break
		<expression_b>
	<expression_c>
```
